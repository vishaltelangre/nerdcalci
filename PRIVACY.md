# Privacy Policy for NerdCalci

Effective date: February 21, 2026

NerdCalci ("the app") is designed to work offline and to keep your data on your device.

## Data We Collect

We do not collect, store, or transmit personal data to the developer from within the app.

The app does not include:
- Advertising SDKs
- Analytics or tracking SDKs
- Crash reporting SDKs
- User account/sign-in systems

## Data Stored on Your Device

NerdCalci stores your calculator content locally on your device, including:
- File names
- Calculation expressions and results
- App preferences (for example, theme settings)

This data is stored in app-local storage (Room database and shared preferences) and is used only to provide app functionality.

## Import, Export, and Clipboard

The app supports optional features initiated by you:
- Import: You can import `.zip` files containing NerdCalci data.
- Export: You can export your data to a `.zip` file at a location you choose.
- Copy with Results: You can copy content to your system clipboard.

These actions occur only when you trigger them.

## Internet and Network Use

NerdCalci does not require internet access for core functionality and does not send your calculator data to remote servers.

The app may open external links (for example, source code, support, or documentation pages) in your browser when you tap those links. Any data handling on those external websites is governed by their own privacy policies.

## Android Backup

Depending on your device and Google account settings, Android may back up app data as part of system backup/restore features. This is managed by Android/Google, not by NerdCalci.

## Data Sharing and Selling

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties.

## Children’s Privacy

NerdCalci is a general audience app and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Security

Because data is primarily stored locally on your device, protecting device access (screen lock, account security, backups) is an important part of keeping your data safe.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be reflected by revising the effective date in this document.
